Let me explain the flow like a letter going through a mail system! 

When someone uses your app (like sending a letter), here's the journey:

1. First Stop: `server.js`
This is like the main post office that receives all letters (requests). It's always running and waiting at port 3000, ready to receive requests.

2. Next Stop: `app.js`
Think of this as the sorting facility. It looks at each request and decides where it should go. It has special rules (middleware) to check and process each request. When it sees "/users" in the address, it knows to send it to the user department.

3. Then: `user.routes.js` 
This is like the detailed sorting machine. It looks at what specific user-related thing is needed (like registration). Before letting the request continue, it checks if everything is filled out correctly (validation) - like making sure an address is written properly on an envelope.

4. Moving to: `user.controller.js`
This is like the postal worker who processes the letter. They read what needs to be done and make it happen. For registration, they take the user's information and prepare it for storage.

5. Through: `user.service.js` & `user.model.js`
These work together like the filing system. The model is like the rules for how to store information (what cabinet, what folder), and the service handles the actual filing work.

6. Finally: Database (through `db.js`)
This is like the secure storage vault where all the important information is kept safe.

The response then travels back through these steps:
Database → Model → Service → Controller → Routes → App → Server → Back to the user

At each step, something important happens:
- The server receives the request
- The app directs it to the right place
- Routes check if it's valid
- Controller processes it
- Model & Service store it
- Database keeps it safe

Then a response goes back to tell the user "Success!" (or if something went wrong, what the problem was).

Does this help make the flow clearer? Would you like me to explain any particular step in more detail?
